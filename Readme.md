This is a tool similar to git-blame, but it shows every line that was ever in the file,
along with information about when it was added or deleted. 

In the screenshot below, the first three columns show information about the commit
where the line was deleted. If those columns are empty, that means the line is present
in the latest version of the file. The next three columns show the commit where the
line was added, and following that is the line itself.
